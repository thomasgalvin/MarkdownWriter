Lists can contain other lists; just indent by four spaces and start a new list:

```markdown
*    One
     *    A
     *    B
          *    i
          *    ii
          *    iii
          *    iv
          *    v
     *    C
*    Two
*    Three
```

And you can mix list styles:

```markdown
*    One
     +    A
     +    B
          -    i
          -    ii
          -    iii
          -    iv
          -    v
     +    C
*    Two
*    Three
```
