[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) was invented by John Gruber, so we'll just let him explain what it is:

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you 
> to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert 
> it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).
> 
> ...
> 
> The overriding design goal for Markdown's formatting syntax is to make it as 
> readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be 
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with 
> tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown's syntax has been influenced by 
> several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration 
> for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email.

Basically, markdown is a way to format your documents without cluttering it up with HTML tags or LaTeX commands. It's a plain text format, which means it can be written (and read) pretty much anywhere.

It's also very intuitive; markdown uses a lot of conventions that arose naturally from plain-text email. Chances are you've already used something that looks a lot like Markdown without even knowing it.

Markdown is also a lot more portable than other formats. You don't need to install special software to read it, and you don't have to worry about the Markdown document you created on your Mac at home looking different on your PC at work.

Finally, markdown can be exported to a number of formats: HTML, PDF, ePub, Microsoft Word, and on and on. It provides "write once, publish anywhere" convenience.
