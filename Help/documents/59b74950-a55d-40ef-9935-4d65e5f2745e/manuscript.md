Markdown Writer supports a variety of input formats: several flavors of markdown, raw HTML, and LaTeX. The best combination of ease-of-use and power, though, probably comes from Pandoc's native markdown format. A complete discussion of this format, and how it differs from traditional Markdown, can be found in the [Pandoc User's Guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown). We'll cover the most important parts here.
