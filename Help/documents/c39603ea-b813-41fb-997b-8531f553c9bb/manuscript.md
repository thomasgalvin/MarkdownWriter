Bulleted lists can begin with an asterisk (`*`), plus-sign (`+`) or dash (`-`). For example:

```markdown
* One
* Two
* Three
```

You can also format "loose lists", where each item is its own paragraph:

```markdown
* One

* Two

* Three
```

List items can wrap along multiple lines:

```markdown
* This is the first item.
  Still the first item
* This is the second item.
* This is the third item.
  Still the third item.
  And some more for the third item.
```

List items can also be multi-paragraph. Just add a blank line between paragraphs and indent them by four spaces.

```markdown
*    Item One.

     Another paragraph for item one.

     The final paragraph of item one.

*    Item Two.

     Another paragraph for item two.

     The final paragraph of item two.

*    Item Three.

     Another paragraph for item three.

     The final paragraph of item three.
